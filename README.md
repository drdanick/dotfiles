Dotfiles
========

This repository contains my ever growing collection of various config files.


Cloning
-------

Since this repository contains submodules, you will need to clone it in the following way:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/drdanick/dotfiles
```


Vim
---

Assuming you cloned the repositories submodules, all that's required to set vim up is to copy .vimrc and .vim/
to your home folder.

To install the vim plugins, start vim and enter the command `PluginInstall`.


License
-------

Although this doesn't really need a license, one has been included.
See LICENSE for details.
